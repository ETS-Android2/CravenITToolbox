The Problem:
I was asked to create an application for the IT department to improve how the technician can operate in the field.  

Solution:
1. I created an android application due to the fact that at the time the IT techs all used Android phones only.  
2. I looked at the data we accessed most or had most need to access while in the field.  
3. Using what I collected for the assistance we needed most I converted that into seperate pages which were links to the data.
4. I created a splashpage first with the possiblity of adding a username and password login.
5. I created buttons on the application that represented "at the time" the techs highest needs when in the field.
6. the Asset Updater / Phone Directory / HelpDesk pages did not require a login.
7. The Scan to Desktop Guide / New Account Setup / ITS WIKI pages all required a login to our internal IT server.  Once that was done the user would be loaded into that page.

Here are the screenshots of my application.
